# Import the db_operations module with an alias 'db_ops' to access database functions.
import db_operations as db_ops
# Import the BackgroundScheduler class from the APScheduler library to run scheduled jobs.
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler

# Create an instance of the BackgroundScheduler. This scheduler will run jobs in the background (i.e., separate from your main program's execution).
scheduler = BackgroundScheduler()

# Define a function that represents the job to be scheduled.
def scheduled_report_job():
    # Call the generate_report function from the db_operations module to create a report.
    # The report_id variable will store the unique identifier for the newly created report.
    report_id = db_ops.generate_report()
    # After generating the report, you can add code here to handle the report, like saving it to a file or emailing it to someone.
    # For now, this is left as a comment for you to implement as needed.
    # Example: You might want to save this report_id in a log or database.

# Add a job to the scheduler. The 'scheduled_report_job' function will be called every 24 hours.
scheduler.add_job(scheduled_report_job, 'interval', hours=24)

# Start the scheduler to begin running scheduled jobs.
scheduler.start()

# If you have any other initialization code or the main routine for your application, it would go here.
# For instance, you might want to start a web server, initialize a GUI, or run a continuous loop for a command-line interface.
# That code would be added below this comment.
